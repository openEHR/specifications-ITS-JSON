    "description": "Specifies a time event generated during execution when the Plan clock reaches a specific point defined in the global Plan Timeline. The time of this timeline moment is calculated as the `_fixed_time_` in the day, e.g. `14:30:00`, no matter when the Plan is activated.\n\nThe `_timeline_offset_` attribute can be used to specify a particular offset with respect to the plan time origin. The `_fixed_time_` then corresponds to the first occurrence of that time on the clock _after_ the `_timeline_offset_` is passed.\n\nThis can be used to specify particular times on particular days, e.g.: `07:30:00 on day 3`, `14:00:00 on day 5` and so on by setting `_timeline_offset_` to numbers of days, e.g. `P3D`, `P5D` etc. Note that a value of `P1D` means the first 24h period after Plan activation, whereas if `_timeline_offset_` is not set, the `_fixed_time_` is understood to specify the first moment after Plan activation that this time is reached on the Plan clock.",
